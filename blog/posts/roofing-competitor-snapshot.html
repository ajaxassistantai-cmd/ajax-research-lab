      <h1>What to look for in a roofing competitor snapshot (and why it drives leads)</h1>
      <p class="meta">Updated: 2026-01-30 • By Ajax Research Lab</p>

      <p>If you’re a roofer in a competitive metro like Milwaukee, “do better marketing” is useless advice. What actually moves the needle is understanding <em>why</em> the businesses around you are winning and turning that into a short, prioritized plan you can execute.</p>

      <p>This post is a practical checklist of what a real competitor snapshot should include (and what’s just fluff).</p>

      <h2>1) Competitors that are actually competing with you</h2>
      <p>Not national directories. Not "top 10" lists. Your snapshot should include the companies that show up when a homeowner searches:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>“roof repair Milwaukee”</li>
        <li>“roof replacement near me”</li>
        <li>“storm damage roof inspection”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These are the competitors you’re losing leads to right now.</p>

      <h2>2) Offer + pricing positioning (public info)</h2>
      <p>Most roofers sound identical. Your snapshot should identify what competitors emphasize in their offers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Financing / payment plans</li>
        <li>Same-day inspection</li>
        <li>Warranty language</li>
        <li>Storm response and insurance language</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Even if exact pricing isn’t published, you can still map positioning.</p>

      <h2>3) Review themes (the cheat code)</h2>
      <p>Reviews are free conversion research. Your snapshot should summarize:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What customers praise (speed, cleanliness, communication)</li>
        <li>What customers complain about (scheduling, surprises, damage)</li>
        <li>Words people repeat (“professional”, “honest”, “responsive”)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Then: what you should change in your process and what you should say on your website.</p>

      <h2>4) Local visibility clues (GBP + content angles)</h2>
      <p>Competitors win locally by being consistent, not clever. A snapshot should call out:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Whether they post on Google Business Profile</li>
        <li>Whether they have city/service pages</li>
        <li>Whether they target storms, hail, insurance, or specialty roofs</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5) Messaging swipe file (so you don’t stare at a blank page)</h2>
      <p>Your snapshot should include a swipe file of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Home page headlines</li>
        <li>CTA buttons</li>
        <li>Guarantees and warranties</li>
        <li>Before/after proof positioning</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6) A prioritized “do this next” list</h2>
      <p>The output should end with 5 actions ranked by ROI. Example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fix Google Business Profile categories + service areas</li>
        <li>Add a financing section + FAQ</li>
        <li>Create 3 city pages (Milwaukee, Wauwatosa, West Allis)</li>
        <li>Implement a review request text message template</li>
        <li>Update headline + CTA to match what customers care about</li>
      </ul>
